# Blog-Card-Component
A blog card component challenge from FrontendPro.

I built this challenge using html & css, it was fun and enjoyable.

They give the design of the challenge as a png file, 
then i tried to build something closer or similar to the design.

I see like a learning approach, so thera a room for imporvement.

I welcome any help, advise from anyone.
